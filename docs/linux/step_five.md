# Create a Docker Hub account & repository

You've built something really cool, you should share it. In this next section,
you'll do just that. You'll need a Docker Hub account. Then, you'll push your
image up to it so other people with Docker can run it.


## Step 1: Sign up for an account

1. Use your browser to navigate to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/?utm_source=getting_started_guide&utm_medium=embedded_Linux&utm_campaign=create_docker_hub_account" target="_blank">the Docker Hub signup page</a>.
	
	Your browser displays the page.
	
	  ![Hub signup](/tutimg/hub_signup.png)

2. Fill out the form on the signup page.

	Docker Hub is free. Docker does need a name, password, and email address.
		
3. Press **Signup**.

	The browser displays the welcome to Docker Hub page.
	

## Step 2: Verify your email and add a repository
	
Before you can share anything on the hub, you need to verify your email address.

1. Open your email inbox.

2. Look for the email titled `Please confirm email for your Docker Hub account`.

  If you don't see the email, check your Spam folder or wait a moment for the email to arrive.

2. Open the email and click the **Confirm Your Email** button.

	 The browser opens Docker Hub to your profile page.

4. Choose **Add Repository**.

	The browser opens the **Add Repository** page.

5. Leave the Namespace alone but enter a repository name and description.

6. Make sure you are creating a **Public** repository.

    When you are done, your form should look similar to the following:

    ![Add repository](/tutimg/add_repository.png)

6. Press **Add Repository** when you are done.

	Docker Hub creates your new repository.

## Where to go next

On this page, you opened an account on Docker Hub and created a new repository.
In the next section, you populate the repository [by tagging and pushing the
image you created earlier](/linux/step_six).
